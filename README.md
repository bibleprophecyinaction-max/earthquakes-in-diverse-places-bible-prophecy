# Earthquakes in Diverse Places – What the Bible Foretold

Across the world, the frequency and intensity of earthquakes have become part of daily news. Many people are asking: *Is this increase random, or did the Bible speak about such times?*

## What Jesus Said About Earthquakes
In Matthew 24:7 (KJV), the Lord Jesus Christ warned that in the last days there would be:
- Nations rising against nations  
- Famines and pestilences  
- **Earthquakes in diverse places**

These signs were given in response to the disciples’ question about the sign of His coming and the end of the world (Matthew 24:3).

## Why This Matters Today
Recent global seismic events remind us of the fragility of our world and the urgency of spiritual preparedness. The Bible presents these signs not to create fear, but to awaken hearts and point people to repentance and faith in Christ.
